  <h1>Hashes and Grouping</h1>
  <h2>How to use the group_by method to make your life easier</h2>
  <h4>March 1st, 2015</h4>

  <section class="blog">
    <p>
      So one of the most common tasks of a programmer is to group things together and pass them back out. Whether it's a category of products, or a section of customer information, grouping things is vital to programming.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that the above boring sentences are out of the way, lets get to the good stuff, aka how to use the group_by method on your arrays to make grouping simple. The group_by command can be used on any array or hash to group the contents into different categories based on a block that follows the command. The code looks like this:
    </p>
    <p class="code-block">
      array.group_by {|element| element % 2 == 0} # sorts the elements into a group that is divisible by two and a group that is not.
      <br>
      hash.group_by {|key, value| value} # sorts the pairs into groups containing the same value.
    </p>
    <p>
        group_by returns a hash with each key being a category, and each value an array of all of the elements that fall into that category. This flexibility is afforded by both arrays and hashes being enumerable objects. group_by is not itself a method for either the array or the hash class, it is instead a method of the enumerable class. I hope this has provided a little trick that will help you in the future! Till next time!
    </p>
