  <h1>Women in tech</h1>
  <h2>Getting the creators of code back into the business</h2>
  <h4>March 1st, 2015</h4>

  <section class="blog">
    <p>
      Probably the biggest problem for the tech industry as a whole, is that we're one of the most sexist industries around. The vast majority of coders are men, and while women are just as capable programmers as men, harassment, and sexism plague them. So what happened, and is there anything we can do?
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding">According to NPR</a>, women used to major in computer science courses in large numbers, until around 1984. Around that time is when personal computers started to become common on the market. However, they weren't marketed as the work platforms that we know today. Instead, they were marketed as toys, and like most toys, they were marketed with a heavy gender bias. As you might have guessed, they were marketed as toys for boys, and as NPR concludes (and I agree) this lead to very few women picking up computers and tinkering with them. Play is crucial for learning, and if you talk to successful professionals in the tech industry, you will find that a large portion of them started on the path to professional coding when they started playing with computers. Tinkering seems to lead to mastery as long as there is interest in the subject, so it comes as no surprise that a large number of boys tinkering with computers lead to a large number of men in the tech industry.
    </p>

        So, that said, what can we do about it? Following my line of reasoning, the thing that would help get more women into the tech industry is to get more young women to tinker with computers, and to encourage their activities as something that is "for everyone" instead of something for girls or boys specifically. School programs aimed at young coders would be helpful in that regard, with extra care taken to ensure an encouraging, safe environment for all. A second avenue to more women in technology is to market technology to women, but as a tool for them instead of a product for them to consume. If computers were marketed to young women with the goal of getting them to look under the hood, instead of treating computers as some sort of black box, we could get this trend turned around. One example of this message that has given me personally a great deal of hope is the game "Minecraft." The largest portion of minecraft's user base are teens and younger, and unofficial numbers from server admins suggest that one in three minecraft players are female. This is no accident, as minecraft itself is a very gender neutral game, almost like Legos. However, the feature that gives me so much hope for minecraft as a way to get women into coding is not the game itself, but rather the game's ability to be extended and modded easily. There are already <a href="http://www.youthdigital.com/courses.html">classes on how to mod minecraft aimed at children</a>, and there are massive amounts of information and tutorials about how to add your own parts to the game. By encouraging people to go under the hood of the game, Mojang has motivated a large portion of their user base to tinker with code, and their female users along with them.
        more programs in schools aimed at female participations, market computers and computer programing to women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obviously I am by no means an expert, but I think it is definitely in everyone's best interest to get more women into coding, asap. Perhaps some of the ideas listed above will help, but regardless, it is a problem that needs to be fixed, and soon.
