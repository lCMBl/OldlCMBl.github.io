  <h1>Blog in review</h1>
  <h2>What it's like making a blog for your internets</h2>
  <h4>April 5th 2015</h4>
  <!--link_name::name::-->

  <section class="blog">
    <p>
      So, one of the things we were tasked with for DBC was making a blog to document our increased knowledge. While I can honestly say I have learned many more things about html and DOM manipulation, I feel like there was never enough time in the day to get it all implemented on my site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jquery and frameworks could really make this web page look snazzy, and I made it a point to do both the DOM manipulation challenge and the Jquery challenge to expand my html knowledge. Right now though, you'll have to take my word for it. Moving to a new city and starting DBC Proper tomorrow does not a lot of time for a blog make.
    </p>
    <p>
      All in all, I am quite glad we were asked to do the blogs. It gave me an opportunity to really get out and try the things they were asking us to do in the phase 0 challenges. It was a definitely a great experience, and a powerful teaching tool. Till next time!
