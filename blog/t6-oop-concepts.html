  <h1>OOP vs. Functional</h1>
  <h2>OR, of objects and calculus.</h2>

    <p>
      Currently at DBC, my cohort mates and I are learning Object Oriented programming. This is a programming paradigm that focuses on structuring code in a manner similar to objects in the real world. Objects in the real world have properties, and in OOP these are represented by instance variables in the program's objects. Additionally, Objects in the real world may have actions that they can preform, such as a bicycle changing gears or a light turning on. Methods are used to give programming objects actions that they can perform, thus completing the analogy. Basically, in OOP you create applications by conceptualizing the different parts of the problem as objects, and creating a system through which they can interact.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another programming paradigm that is important to know about is Functional Programing. Here, the "Functional" refers to mathematical functions, and not that the programing style is simply more effective. This is the key difference between OOP and FP. Where OOP seeks to solve problems using code conceptualized as objects, FP seeks to solve problems by modeling the behavior of mathematical functions acting upon each other.
    </p>
    <p>
        In OOP, a function is like a subroutine of code. It is a list of actions that can be called whenever needed. In FP, a function is literally a mathematical equation that performs some operation on the inputs, and returns the outputs. That it returns the outputs is key, because therein lie the practical differences between OOP and FP. In FP, calling a function with the same inputs should always return the same outputs. This means that the program never changes states, and so such things as assignments and functions which return nothing are not seen in FP. As you may have noticed, both of these practices are common in OOP. In OOP, If I run a method which changes some variable, and then run that same method with the same input again, I could receive a different output. In FP, the function will always return the same value if I give it the same input.
    </p>
    <p>
        From a more comprehensive perspective, FP and OOP are different in terms of which type of problem they solve best. If you have a set number of operations that you wish to perform, but have a variable number of <i>things</i> you want to perform these operations on, then OOP will better serve your interests. It is much easier to add a new <i>thing</i> in OOP and then perform the same operations on it than it is for FP. If you have a set number of things, but have a variable number of operations that you wish to perform on them, then FP is your best bet. Put simply, If I want to add a new <i>thing</i> in FP, I am going to have to write a lot of new code. BUT if I just want the things I already have to do something different, this is relatively simple to do. I won't have to go back and change all the other functions, I just have to write a new one. The exact opposite is true of OOP. If I want to add a new operation, I'm going to have to go through a lot of my classes to make sure they can handle it. But if I want a new class of <i>things</i> to  play with, then I don't need to bother looking at the others before I make it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope this has been informing, and that before you start in on a problem, you spare some time to think about which paradigm would best serve your interests!
