      Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?
What was the source of the conflict?
What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?
What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?
If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?
What did you learn from this experience?


    </p>
    <p>
      I have experienced small conflicts with my brother about the state of our bathroom on multiple occasions. While not major, it is definitely a re-occurring source of friction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arguments stemmed from who's responsibility it was to clean the bathroom. The drains need to be unclogged on occasion, and of course everything needs to be wiped down regularly. Additionally, supplies like toilet paper and soap need to be refilled often.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt very frustrated whenever I would clean up parts of the bathroom, as I felt that at some points it was not my mess, and in other points that it would get dirty again immediately due to lack of respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dealt with the problem by cleaning most of the bathroom in exchange for not having to do other chores elsewhere. I have a lower tolerance for mess than my brother, so this worked out well.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I could go back, I would probably have tried to get my brother to understand my frustration more, instead of just trying to make a compromise without addressing the behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably not the thing I should have taken away from this, but I really think that having my own bathroom is the best way for me to live in the future. In situations where that's impossible, having a talk about who is responsible for what might help.
