  <h1>Affirmation</h1>
  <h2>or, how to combat stereotype threat</h2>
  <h4>March 22nd, 2015</h4>

  <section class="blog">
    <p>
      Achievement, Challenge, Intellectual status, Creativity, Quality, Kindness, and Public Service are some of the values that relate to times where I have felt at my happiest, proudest, or most satisfied. Generally speaking, I try to hold myself to these values:
    </p>
    <p>Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- [5] Agree</p>
    <p>
       Of the values that I listed, I think Achievement is the most important one to me. I find that the times in life when I feel the most proud of myself are right after I have accomplished something large, like a project or climbing a mountain. Often times, I ended up going above and beyond, and this extra work that ended up creating a really cool result is the thing that I think gets me the most.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last time someone asked for my advice, it was about a social matter. Specifically, they were wondering when they should text someone and what they should say. I don't think it really related to any of the values that I hold dear, though I do think I was asked in the first place because of my reputation for kindness. (It definitely wasn't because I'm a social genius, at any rate.)
    </p>
    <p>
      I tend to feel comforted when I think about good things that I have done, or large things that I've accomplished. There are some memories that I have to stay away from, as perhaps I did a great project, but thinking of it reminds me of a later project which I messed up, and that brings me down very quickly. I think contemplating these things can definitely help combat stereotype threat. It's hard to feel bad that I might be promoting the stereotype of nerds being bad socially when I'm remembering that time that everyone was blown away by the project I made. Something else I have found helps is to interact with people who value the same things, such that I can easily feel good about myself by exemplifying my values to those who appreciate them. (though of course, this is more of a logistics problem than a theoretical one.) When I'm feeling down at DBC, I think taking a walk, or putting in my headphones and looking at old projects will definitely help me calm down or feel better.
