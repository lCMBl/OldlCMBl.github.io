  <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
  <h2>OR, why I stopped playing D&D</h2>
  <h4>March 15th, 2015</h4>

      So, middle school was a big time for me. I know, most people recal college or highschool when asked about their formative years, but for me, middle school is where I was set on my current path. For background, my dad was the school librarian at the school that I attended, and I would always accompany him when he left to go to work. This meant that I was always in the library about an hour before class started, just hanging out. There was another kid who also arrived about an hour early, because his mother had a long commute for work, and she needed to drop him off before continuing on to her job. Needless to say, him and I became good friends.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was doing pretty well in school at the time. Despite being in 7th grade, I was tested at a 12th grade reading level. My language arts teacher even gave me a special book to do my book report on, because she thought that the book the rest of the class was going to use would bore me. So, she gave a 7th grader Frank Herbert's DUNE to read, and single handedly launched my interest in sci-fi. It was around this time that my friend and I began to hang out inside during recess. We would still go out and play soccer on occasion, but he had discovered this book written by Gary Gygax, about this game called dungeons and dragons. We spent many a lunch hour looking over it, or talking about different aspects of it. But, as this is a post about how I stopped playing, you can guess that something happened.
    </p>

       Around this time is when we began to talk about girls, and my friend and I quickly found ourselves cast into the "nerd" category because of our activities. We were smart, we stayed inside at recess, we really did hit a lot of the stereotypes on the head. But, we wanted to fit in, even if just a little bit. So, we started to suppress some of our hobbies. We would still chat about computers and in particular a game called starcraft, but these were our own private conversations, and no one would mark us as "nerds" without listening in. On the other hand, the D&D had to go. After all, to fit in we had to go to recess, which meant we needed to drop the lunchtime tabletop sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In essence, I was afraid of being labeled with all of the negative things of being a nerd, all of the social inequities and undesirableness of that social group. So, I did what I thought was best and started trying to disprove the stereotype, and hide anything that might confirm it. I think <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/thin-ice-stereotype-threat-and-black-college-students/304663/">Claude M. Steele</a> was exactly right that everyone identifies with at least one group that has negative stereotypes associated with it, and I can personally say that I routinely hide some of my interests or curb my enthusiasm to avoid negative aspects of the "nerd" label that I associate with.

      I told you all that so I can discuss, briefly, that the main way I feel that stereotype threat can be negated. I think the easiest way to stop people from feeling threatened by stereotypes is to make sure they understand that there actions are not reflection on the area of life that the stereotype concerns. What I mean by this is, Like Claude found, if they told students that a test was a measure of ability, they were affected by stereotype threat. However, if they were told that the test was just a lab exercise, the students didn't feel threatened. I think that just as the students fear of proving a stereotype based around lack of ability wasn't activated when it was stressed that the activity did not reflect on their ability, Someone like me could be set at ease if they were reassured that their actions did not reflect on their social skills, for example. At any rate, I have run out of time, so hopefully I have given people some thoughts to consider.
