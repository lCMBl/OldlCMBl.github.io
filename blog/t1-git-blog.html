      This week I've learned a bit about the command line and gotten more familiar with Git and GitHub. Now I've been charged to write a post explaining these concepts to beginners. Without further ado, I will be addressing:

        -What are the benefits of version control?
        -How does git help you keep track of changes?
        -Why use GitHub to store your code?
    </p>
    <p>
        To start off, the benefits of version control are obvious to anyone who has ever had a computer crash on them. Put simply, YOU WON'T LOSE YOUR STUFF. Or, at least not <i>all</i> of it. Version control allows you to make many saved versions of your project as you go along. Of course, I guarantee your text editor has a save function, so big whoop right? Well, Version control also allows you to not only work with other people without tripping over them, but also try new directions for the project at no extra cost. If I somehow introduce a terrifying bug into this file (say, a picture of myself in middle school) then instead of having to skip town and change my name, with version control I only have to roll back to the previous version, no sweat.
    </p>
    <p>
        Okay, so now that you think version control might be a good idea, the next most important thing is how it works. Git (which is one of the most popular tools for version control) works by using <i>Commits</i> to track progress. A commit is simply a point at which you like the changes you have made, and decide to <i>Commit</i> to having them in the project. Each one of these commits generates an entry in the log of the project, which you can go back and check later, or even return to at another point.
    </p>
    <p>
        So why use GitHub to store your code? Well you see, version control really shines when used to let more than one person work on a project at a time. However, Git needs to make sure that everyone's projects are on the same page. This is fine as long as everyone is online, but what happens when I want to make changes to the project, and everyone else is offline? Even worse, what happens when I go to bed, and everyone else gets back online, and makes a bunch of changes to the project before my changes can be enacted? It's a good way to end up with a lot of needless work and merge conflicts. GitHub solves this problem nicely, but providing a Hub that is always online, that everyone can push and pull from.
    </p>

        That's all for now folks! Catch you real soon, I'm sure.
