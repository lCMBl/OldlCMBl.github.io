  <h1>Asking the right question</h1>
  <h2>Or, you won't strike gold without a map.</h2>

      The First step to becoming good at something is to realize that you aren't good at it yet, and that you should probably seek some guidance. Platitudes aside, asking questions is a big part of programming. In general, most problems that you could ever want to solve have already been solved by someone else. Regardless, it isn't enough to just take a solution and use it without thinking. This means that everyone at some point needs to ask questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, another platitude is "ask a stupid question and get a stupid answer." 9 times out of 10, the knowledge that you seek is already there, but unless you know how to ask for it, you won't get what you need. So, how do you ask a good question?
    </p>
    <p>
        When asking a question, keep in mind that you have to somehow bring the people listening to you up to speed on what's going on. If the gist of the question takes a paragraph to explain, then you're probably going to lose people in the process of explaining it. Breaking down your problem into easy to explain, easy to understand chunks is crucial. To that end, provide any research you have already done, and create a way for the problem to be replicated. Many eyes make a bug small, but you want to make sure that they are all looking at the same bug.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's all for now! tomorrow, phase 1 starts, with all it's glory. And all it's horror.
