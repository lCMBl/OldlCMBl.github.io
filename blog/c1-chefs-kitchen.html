  <h1>DBC - The Hackerspace of the development world</h1>
  <h2></h2>
  <h4>February 7th 2015</h4>

  <section class="blog">

      My prompt this time is as follows:

      Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?

      Talk about what came up for you and anything you want in addition to the questions above.
    </p>
    <p>
        My take on the Dev Bootcamp experience is that DBC is almost more like a hackerspace than a school. As was mentioned in the video, one of the important things to remember about DBC is that we're all in this together, as opposed to the traditional school system of trying to cram away knowledge. This was most definitely the case with the different hackerspaces that I've been to, and I am even more excited for DBC if that is the atmosphere there.
    </p>
    <p>
        The type of culture that says it's okay to experiment and learn from each other, and acknowledges that it's okay to not have answers, is one that I see myself joyfully engaging with. The video has certainly changed my expectations of DBC, for the better. Previously, I certainly had the pay money => get job mentality towards DBC. Now, (as I've already mentioned) I'm thinking of it more like a hackerspace and community with which I will enjoy engaging on something besides a mere transactional level. In particular, I found the idea that we're here to learn the general approach to development instead of a specific language or application very appealing. One of the things that skeptical friends often told me before I applied for boot camp was that ruby was on it's way out, and I should learn 'insert pet language here' instead. I'm glad that the skills I learn at DBC will be applicable regardless of language.
    </p>
    <p>
        The last thing about the video that I wanted to bring up was a connection I made with the answer to the question about feeling like borrowing someone's ideas is plagiarism. It sounds to me that coding, rather than being analogous to the traditional classroom test, is more like minecraft or legos. In the same way that it would be absurd to try and peek at a friend's construction to find the "right" way of doing things, so it is to take a code snippet as the "right" way of doing things.
    </p>
    <p>
       I am a little bit nervous, as an introvert, to participate in such a social learning environment, but the face that DBC recognizes the differences between extroverts and introverts is a great comfort, and builds my excitement even more!
