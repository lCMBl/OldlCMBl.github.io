      So, many people throw around the term "Rails" like it's supposed to make sense to anyone who's touched a computer. In all fairness, Rails is a fairly big deal in web development, but if you're like me, at some point you realized that you had no idea what Rails was, and at this point, are too scared to ask. So, Lets discuss what Rails actually is, shall we?
    </p>
    <p>
      The simple, one sentence explanation of Rails is that Rails is a software framework for creating web applications. Well that's all well and good, but now we need to know what a software framework is. So lets start out simply. You know how when you want to type up a report, you probably use a word processor, for instance, Microsoft Word? Well, in a way that word processor is like a "text framework." It is a series of tools for dealing with and manipulating text. In a similar sense, a software framework is an application or group of applications that provide different tools for manipulating your target medium. In this case, Rails is focused on making it easy to create and interact with web applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      One key thing to remember is that Rails is not in a neat, graphical format like a word processor. Instead, working with Rails requires working with code of some sort. In addition, Rails is itself a collection of different solutions to different problems or tasks, commonly called a stack. In other words, Rails is a group of useful tools and code which has been stacked into a platform, upon which you can build your application.
