  <h1>Feeling the feedback</h1>
  <h2>Pairing and the social side of DBC</h2>
  <h4>March 8th, 2015</h4>

      Pairing with another person to solve challenges was... interesting. For most of my life I've been a solo programmer, and frankly, there are some things that I really enjoy about pair programming, and some things that really wear on my during my pairing sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The fun parts of pairing were finding solutions we were stuck on before, or finding a neat hack to show the other person. There are definitely some real benefits to pair programming, and I would say that for the most part, I benefited from having someone else to bounce ideas off of and spot bugs with my code.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, there are some really frustrating parts of pair programming for me. Namely, I feel that the driving and navigating roles can sometimes be very restricting, and the match up of skill can be problematic. Many times while pairing, I felt like I had a potential solution, but couldn't quite describe it to the driver, (a reflection on my own skill, of course.) or felt like I couldn't just go ahead and try it without the navigator's go ahead. Furthermore, I enjoy teaching others, so having a new trick to show someone is always nice, but when it's the other way around and I'm the one behind, I feel very much like a burden, and it takes a lot of the fun out of it for me.
    </p>
    <p>
        Reading my feedback made me feel quite good about myself. Knowing that I'm doing a good job is comforting. For the most part, my feedback didn't contain anything major that I had to work on, so I suppose the lesson that I'm taking from it is to keep doing what I'm doing for the most part.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the biggest places that I can improve in as far as my pairing sessions go is being more assertive while driving. There have been several times where I've had a potential solution, and I've held back on saying it because I didn't feel like it was my place to interject. One of the people that I paired with picked up on this, and recommended that I embrace my assertive side, as long as I continue to be polite.
    </p>
    <p>
        Writing feedback was probably one of the harder things I've had to do at DBC, because I've had to fight the urge to sugar coat things every step of the way. Going hand in hand with this though is the problem that I have finding things in need of feedback in the first place. Most times, I am completely satisfied with my pairing sessions, which leaves me little or no actionable pieces of advice to give.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, I think the pairing and feedback system is a worthwhile way of learning. When you and your pair are stuck on something, it's easy to forget that learning to code is not the sole purpose of the pairing sessions, and that learning how to interact with people in preparation for the workplace is a major part of pairing.
