  <h1>Thinking Style</h1>
  <h2>What is it like inside of Christian's mind?</h2>
  <h4>Feb 22, 2015</h4>

  <section class="blog">
    <p>
      So this post is going to be all about what it's like to have my mind, in the context of the Gregorc thinking styles. To briefly describe them, there are four thinking styles, Concrete Sequential, Concrete Random, Abstract Sequential, and Abstract Random.
    </p>
    <p>
        From the names, you can sort of understand what these thinking styles mean, but a brief description would probably still be helpful.
        <ul>
          <li>Concrete Sequential thinking is typical of mathematic activities, and people who think this way are pragmatic and prefer structured and ordered environments.</li>
          <li>Concrete Random thinking is still concerned with practical applications and actually doing things, but the prefer an unstructured approach. They will often dive right in, relying on their intuition.</li>
          <li>Abstract Sequential thinkers prefer to logically step out all of the pieces of a problem before committing it to action. In this way they are more theoretical than pragmatic.</li>
          <li>Abstract Random thinkers prefer to listen before giving their own input, and tend to focus more on the overall problem and goal, instead of specific details.</li>
        </ul>

        When I took the quiz to determine my type, I managed to score high in everything besides Concrete sequential thinking, with my highest score in Abstract Random thinking. For me, this means that to enjoy success in learning environments, I need spaces where I can listen first, and then have the freedom to jump in and start trying things. At DBC, this probably means that I work best when I can start out as a navigator, and then switch to a driving roll at some point. This also means that small groups will probably help me to learn more effectively.

    </p>
    <p>
        Speaking of DBC, so far my experience has been extremely positive! Of course, right now I'm only in phase 0, but I have already met several of the people that I will be working with in Chicago, and gotten a taste of the culture. To say the least, I am extremely impressed with what I am experiencing now, and the knowledge that I will be getting more intensive education at the on-site portion is both exciting and nerve-wracking.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, despite my progress with the DBC curriculum, I still find myself struggling to achieve a growth mindset. Often, I will feel like I am not smart enough to solve a problem if I spend too long working on it, or have no idea how to solve it in the first place. Achieving a mindset that failure is acceptable is definitely a very hard thing for me to grasp, and I find that if I don't pay attention to my thoughts, I will often slip back into old habits of perfectionism and insecurity when it comes to my work.
