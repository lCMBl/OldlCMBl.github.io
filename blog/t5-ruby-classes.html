  <h1>A little bit of Class</h1>
  <h2>Using classes in ruby</h2>

      Classes are quite possibly one of the most important subjects in Object oriented programming, because classes are the blueprints that you make the aforementioned objects from! For starters, imagine my piece of code is a bike factory. I wouldn't be happy if my factory made just one bike, and writing out a bunch of statements like "make_bike_frame(), paint_bike(green), gears_on_bike(4)" would be just about the worst way you could do it. Also, this way would only let you have one bike anyway! If I'm going to have a bike factory, I'm going to need classes.
    </p>
    <p>
        As I stated before, a class is sort of like a blueprint. After I've defined a class, I can use it to make as many copies of the object as I want, in a much easier fashion than using a collection of methods like I did above. my_bike = Bicycle.new('green', 4) could be used to give us a new, 4 speed, green bike, instead of having to write each part individually. Probably the most important aspect of this though is that I could make a different bike no problem, just by saying her_bike = Bicycle.new('red', 8). Now I have two SEPERATE bike objects, and they each have their own properties.
    </p>
    <p>
        Basically, you should use a class anytime you feel like you are going to need multiple instances of similar objects in order to get things done. For example, if you were to program a game of solitaire, you should ABSOLUTELY make a "Card" class, instead of programming each card individually.
